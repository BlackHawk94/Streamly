YouTube streaming made simple

## What is Streamly?
Streamly is a client side YouTube video streaming page.

Our motto is simplicity which is why we do not use any external API's to manipulate YouTube's native HTML5 video frame.

Our goal is to create a simple way to consecutively play YouTube videos similar to YouTube's current playlist functionality with the difference of being able to add videos to the queue at any time.
