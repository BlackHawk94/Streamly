# Streamly
YouTube video streaming, extremely simple.

## What is Streamly?
Streamly is a client side YouTube video streaming page.

Our motto is simplicity which is why we do not use any external API's to manipulate YouTube's native HTML5 video frame.

Our goal is to create a simple way to consecutively play YouTube videos similar to YouTube's current playlist functionality with the difference of being able to add videos to the queue at any time.

For any questions or comments, please leave an Issue.

## Why does Streamly require the video's length?

Due to the no-API nature of Streamly, it is a little different from other YouTube streamers. This means that it will not retrieve the video's length (needed for playlists). It also will not retrieve the exact name of the video you load.

But the good thing is that you control everything about the video you are playing! And there are no loose ties with YouTube's API...
