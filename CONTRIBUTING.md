# Contributing Guide

Hi! Welcome to my project Streamly.

Streamly is open to any and all pull requests with very few rules as I myself am not formally trained in the languages which it is written in.

Even as a beginner, I'd like to lay out a couple of formats that I follow. Following these in your PR will help Streamly to be more organized.

All indents should be two-spaces, following how the code is written now.

Functions should be formatted:

```
function myFunction() {
  //code here, indented two spaces
}
```

Global variables, though heavily used now in the code, should be kept at a minimum. Some applications require them though, so by all means don't drive yourself crazy avoiding them.

OOP would be great, even though not used much in the current code.

Comments are used prior to every function, or when a conditional or variable is used in an unexpected manner.

Thanks again for contributing!
